# Using Resources in Hot Design

In Hot Design, you can assign values to properties using **resources**, which contain predefined values stored in your application that promote reuse and consistency. These can include brushes, strings, thicknesses, numbers, and more.


## What Are Resources?

Resources are values defined in XAML using keys and are typically defined in `App.xaml`, `Page.Resources`, or `MergedDictionaries`. For example:

- `StaticResource` – Resolved once when the control is loaded.
- `ThemeResource` – Dynamically resolved based on the current app theme (Light or Dark).

```xml
<SolidColorBrush x:Key="AccentBrush" Color="#FF0078D7" />
```


## Applying a Resource

To assign a property from a resource, open the Advanced Flyout by clicking the three-dot button next to a property.

- Select the Resource tab.
- Type the key name of your resource, or choose from the suggestions list that appears.
- Once selected, the property will display a resource-indicator icon.

Hot Design supports auto-suggest for both `StaticResource` and `ThemeResource`, making it easier to pick from available keys without memorizing them.


## Resource Scope

The available resource keys depend on where they're defined:

- **Local**: in the same page or control.
- **Application-wide**: in App.xaml or globally merged dictionaries.
- **Themed resources**: change automatically with Light/Dark mode.

> [!NOTE] Prefer ThemeResource for brushes or fonts that should adapt to theme changes.


## Editing or Removing a Resource

To remove a resource assignment:

- Reopen the Advanced Flyout and switch back to the Value tab to assign a literal value, or
- Clear the input field in the Resource tab.


## Common Use Cases

- Background, Foreground, and BorderBrush → Use brush resources.
- FontSize and Padding → Use number/thickness resources.
- Text → Use localized string resources.
